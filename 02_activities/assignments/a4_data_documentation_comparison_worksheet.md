| **Sample size**                                       | Approximately 24,000 completed questionnaires from a field sample of ~50,000 units        | 37,822 respondents in the campaign-period survey | 112 wild-caught bats for dietary analysis; 15 captive bats for behavioral experiments |
| **Target population**                                 | Persons aged 15 and over living in the ten provinces of Canada                            | Canadian citizens or permanent residents aged 18 and over | *Glossophaga soricina* bats in Costa Rica and captive bats at University of Bristol |
| **Sampling frame**                                    | Combined landline and cellular phone numbers linked to dwelling addresses                 | Qualtrics online panel participants meeting eligibility criteria | Wild bats captured using mist nets in Costa Rica; captive bats in laboratory colony |
| **Survey mode(s)**                                    | Electronic Questionnaire (EQ) and Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI)         | Online self-administered questionnaire      | Field capture and guano analysis; laboratory behavioral experiments; acoustic modeling |
| **Timeline**                                          | Data collected from September 4 to December 28, 2018; released January 26, 2021           | Conducted during the 2019 federal election campaign (September to October 2019) | Field data collected from late May to early July 2009; lab experiments over nine days |
| **Response rate**                                     | Overall response rate of 41.9%                                                            | Traditional response rates not calculated; post-election re-interview rate was 27.3% | Not applicable |
| **Weights**                                           | Person-level weights to produce estimates representative of the target population         | Weights based on age, gender, education, and province census distributions | Not applicable |
| **Data processing**                                   | Used SSPE for processing steps and utilities                                              | Pre-processed by removing incomplete responses, duplicates, rapid completions (<8.5 mins), straight-liners, and invalid postal codes | DNA extraction and sequencing; echolocation data recorded and analyzed |
| **Cleaning, imputation, etc.**                        | Imputation using donor records; automatic and manual edits; error detection at multiple levels | Cleaned data for quality; no mention of imputation procedures | Sequence editing and alignment; identification via DNA barcoding; synchronization of audio and video data |
| **Sources of error**                                  | Sampling error; non-sampling errors like coverage error and non-response bias             | Potential selection bias due to non-probability sampling; coverage bias (internet access required); measurement errors | Potential misidentification in DNA analysis due to incomplete reference database; captive bats may not represent wild behavior |
| **Limitations, known biases**                         | Undercoverage of households without phones; non-response bias adjusted through weighting  | Cannot calculate traditional response rates; possible underrepresentation of certain groups; non-probability sample limits generalizability | Small sample sizes; captive bats naÃ¯ve to insect prey; results may not generalize to all populations |
